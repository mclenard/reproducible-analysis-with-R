## Origin of data

We rely on the palmerspenguins package for our demo data. Learn more about the package: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/. 

## Dependencies / How to Install

You need the most current version of R and RStudio (RStudio v.2022.07 minimum to follow along with Quarto).

If you have never worked with R Markdown or Quarto before, you might see a dialog titled "Install Required Packages" that will ask if you want to install the required packages, which includes rmarkdown and knitr. Click Yes.

## Project notes 

The Penguins project is the demo part of the ["Reproducible Analysis and Documentation with R and RStudio" workshop](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/repro_analysis_R_RStudio.html).  Start there, and follow the instructions under "Your Turn" (the worms project).
